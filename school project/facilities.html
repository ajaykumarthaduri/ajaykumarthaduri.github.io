					<div class= "card-body"> 
<P > Science fairs became viewed by many as a way to encourage and help students find
 their way into science and engineering career paths.Popularity
 of science fairs increased  along with interest in the sciences after the world witnessed the use of
 the first two atomic weapons and the dawn of television. As the decade
 progressed, science stories in the news, such as Jonas Salk's vaccine for
 polio and the launch of Sputnik, brought science fiction to reality and
 attracted increasing numbers of students at every level to fairs.</p>

<p>Science fairs attract students at every level-elementary,
 middle and high school-to compete in science and technology activities.
 Science fairs also can allow for students with intense interest in the sciences to
 be paired with our faculty, so that the students
 have access to instruction and equipment that the local schools do not provide. This
 mentoring has been shown to be very important for student success.Science exhibitions play
 a crucial role in education. They bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical
 application, making learning more tangible and exciting. They also encourage students to question,
 explore, and discover, which are fundamental aspects of scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>It is spontaneous and allows complete freedom of expression. This method does not strictly 
structured and documented but is flexible depending on the interest and aptitude of the children
 bother the kids, teachers and parents with the concept of home assignments, grades and marks. Assessment
 of overall skills and aptitude of the child is done by the teachers and is communicated to the parents from
 time to time. Preschool and play way in India have been introduced in preschools.</p>

<p>The play way system can be modified and made better by involving ideas from other curriculum or innovative
 inputs. It can also be used in combination with the Montessori and other systems. However, it is beneficial
 if the method is implemented by trained teachers. The pre-school trainer certification offers the knowledge
